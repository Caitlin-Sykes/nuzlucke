1. The api does not support historical data.
    so in gen 6 example, Clefairy became fairy type, before that it was normal pokemon.
    the api will not return "normal" for Clefairy even if we filter by pokemon
    
    solution: we make education guesses for these Pokemon, as there has been very
    few changes in their types. through the years.
    ie, if first type is fairy, and we are before gen 6, it probably was a normal
    type.
    
    if it was a steel type and we are before gen 2, we leave it blank. it likely
    didn't change
    
    i checked the use cases i could think of and noticed the pattern
    
2. some pokemon had evolutions and pre-evolutions that appear after the first generation.
    pre-evolution is a foreign key in the database, so needs to be added. we add a placeholder
    for those missing pokemon to avoid a data integrity issue, then once all the pokemon for that
    generation are added, we go back over and update the placeholders with the correct pokemon
    information.
    
3. I wanted to have a table to store the intended progression of each Pokemon, but I can't
fetch that from the API.
        
        solution:
            I take a few factors:
                - average level of all the walking pokemon per area
                - i have a rough template of the pokemon progression per area based on level
                - i manually map a few key encounters and store them in the milestone table
                
4. Each game has multiple release dates dependent on region
    solution: a date field for each region and the front-end will decide which one to display
